         was to keep the URL state in sync with the page state?

                This is also a good example of a name that could be improved upon as well. 
                Here you are mapping over types and displaying a single type. So the name
                Types doesn't match the data type that is being displayed. Like I said 
                above though, the map could be included and you could keep the name the same
