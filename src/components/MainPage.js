  // Every time the page changes, we want to trigger this request to get the next page of
  // pokemon. 
  //
  // Gaven and Brian are implementing context to their application. 
  // I think this could be useful for you as well. There are a bunch of different ways that
  // requests to this endpoint are happening inside of the app. At the very least I 
  // think that have a single unified way that requests are made would save a lot of
  // headaches and resolve many of the problems and complexity caused by having this code
  // in both of these locations. 
  //
  // It is a bigger change, but I think that by making it it would resolve a lot of
  // the smaller issues you are having around page state and pagination through 
  // the pokedex. 
  // 
  // I'd be happy to help you refactor this stuff all too if you would like :)
